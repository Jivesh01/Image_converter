# Image_converter
This project is a Python script that converts various image formats (e.g., JPG, GIF, BMP) into PNG format. It uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to handle image processing tasks. The script reads images from a specified input folder and saves the converted images in a designated output folder.
